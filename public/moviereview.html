        <h3>Sound of Freedom</h3>
            <p>Showed me how broken the world is and how I do not want to be a part of this world and it's desire to be as sinful as the flesh wants to be.</p>
        <h3>None</h3>
            <p>I have a goal to get to a place where I convince myself that I would rather work than to watch tv or movies. 
                This will save me time, and help me to stay focused on being set apart from this world.</p>

                <p>I am just writing this as filler for this project so that I can learn to write HTML code.</p>
