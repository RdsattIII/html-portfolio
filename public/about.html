      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hello, my name is Roy I am a 2nd year college student pursuing a bachelors in computer science. I wanted to start learning 
        to code outside of college before I start computer classes so that I am not fully unaware what I will be doing when I start 
        these classes. I am currently using a Udemy course to gain knowledge about the basics of web development to start my journey.
      </p>
      
      <p>My hobbies are literally just work and learning. I enjoy the gym, I enjoy learning, and I enjoy making money. Even if I get bored or tired of these I still try
        to convince myself I enjoy working and learning so that I can stay productive even when tired. I do think that relaxing and stepping away from always working is necessary
        when done correctly. I enjoy camping, golf, and watching sports.
      </p>
      
      <p>I do not have social media because I want to push myself to stay focused and achieve whatever my work can bring my way. I am not sure what I am cpable of, or what is feasible
        because I am unfamiliar with the IT field in multiple ways. However, I want to see if I stay focused and keep working, is it possible for me to become a millionare. I do not
        want to reach this goal for arrogance and I want to try to stay humble along the way, but if I can reach this goal I want to help the people who stuck by me along the way. I
        want to reward them for their loyalty and carry them with me if I can succeed. I do not ask much, but when I do it is usually a pretty heavy task, so the people who help me I know
        are true and this is why I trust them to be in my circle.
